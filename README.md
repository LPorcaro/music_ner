# Recognizing Musical Entities in User-generated Content

We present a novel method for detecting musical entities from user-generated content, modelling linguistic features with statistical models and extracting contextual information from a radio schedule.  We analyzed tweets related to a classical music radio station, integrating its schedule to connect users' messages to tracks broadcasted.
