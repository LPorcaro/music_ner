@drol007 @BBCRadio3 Good to keep these birds on the agenda @drol007 . We all need to look after them .. and their habitats .
@BBCRadio3 is playing birdsong and it is PERFECT . It is a recording of a dawn chorus from May 2010 . Can‚Äôt see why it didn‚Äôt chart .
Same sounds outside and inside , thanks @BBCRadio3 , lovely broadcast of singing nightingales .
It‚Äôs that time , when you hear wildlife on @BBCRadio3
It 's International Dawn Chorus Day ! So : can you identify this bird from its song alone ?
It 's a glorious morning &amp; I have some glorious music lined up for #SundayMorning @BBCRadio3 , inc wonderful vocal sounds from @Papagenasingers , plus Raff , Clara Scumann , and Barry Douglas collaborating with @mckaystout . Join me from 9 (@7digitalCreativ )
Tolly cat would like me to say that he very much appreciates the birdsong on @BBCRadio3 - the radio station with something for every human and cat .
@BBCRadio3 thank you for the birds song today . Unfortunately our cat didn‚Äôt pay any attention to it ! He was more interested 8n having his Breakfast ,
. @bbcradio3 .... delightful
@cbhallgardens : . @bbcradio3 .... delightful Shared via TweetCaster
@MaplesonF @traumagasdoc @BBCRadio3 Well it just happens that I have a pet manatee that keeps running into things .....
@BBCRadio3 despite it being a glorious morning here in Manchester the dawn chorus was somewhat underwhelming !
@redmond_tom @BBCRadio3 @TomParnellMcr @bonaomi1 You did that all the while carrying your own water in the side pocket of your rucksack !
@Sleepy_Suz @traumagasdoc @BBCRadio3 Well , send them to the bedroom I had as a teenager , where I apparently have an optometry lab in my wardrobe ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@MaplesonF @traumagasdoc @BBCRadio3 Excellent ! Will DM you for directions .
@BBCRadio3 Honey sweet Dawn chorus in the Garden Of England coming home from Street Pastor Patrol in Maidstone this morning #internationaldawnchorusday
Is it just a load of old conkers ? How the beloved horse chestnut tree is ' pretty useless'...
Been trying to get out of bed since 8am but @BBCRadio3 breakfast playing such wonderful music I cannot move .....
Tippett 's Dance , Clarion Air on @BBCRadio3 was a good ( late ) start to Sunday morning .
@BBCRadio3 Excellent tweet to start my day . But the chiff-chaff ‚Äúdumpy‚Äù , I think not , it is really elegant .
Through the Night : music from around Europe , starting at 2017 @bbcproms with Adams , Dvo≈ô√°k üéª &amp; Mahler 1st Symphony @mutterviolinne @HellTweet @pghsymphony @manfredhoneck ( cc @WQEDFM ) Listen here in HD sound for 30 days
Thanks to @BBCRadio3 for a nice plug for @ECEChoral Concert of two Bach motets at the beautiful St Cross Hospital , Winchester at 5pm today . Free of charge . Do come .
@BBCRadio3 Your picture is of a sycamore tree . If you're after a horse chestnut - think conkers .

@drsarahwalker @BBCRadio3 @Papagenasingers @mckaystout @7digitalCreativ You‚Äôre playing all my favourite music this morning- used to play this Tippett at school and Tippett once conducted me playing solo violin 1 - unforgettable experience !
Wonderful piece on my album with @fantasticdrfox on @BBCRadio3 from last night 's hear and now we are on at 11min but it 's a great programme with @Neilluck introducing some great albums incl @RailtonLucy fab new cd .
@BenHoward__ @nickluscombe @BBCRadio3 @MusicityGlobal thanks Ben !
@BBCRadio3 @BBCtrending well worth a listen .
Brilliant sounds from @Papagenasingers on #SundayMorning w @drsarahwalker @BBCRadio3 now
Looking forward to hearing a recent performance of Artie Shaw 's Clarinet Concerto on Wednesday @BBCRadio3 . It was first heard in the Fred Astaire film Second Chorus ( 1940 ) - a film biography of Shaw . Harry James later recorded a version on his 1955 album Jazz Session .
@BBCRadio3 Wonderful mix of music this morning @drsarahwalker . I was just writing a piece on Dumbarton Oaks when you played . Now on of my favourite pieces of Walton - Partita , clearly has echoes of the first symphony .
@BBCRadio3 Billie Holiday on R3 ... fab and looking forward to the nightingales tonight if I can stay awake

THANX @Neilluck and Robert Worby for their words about my album last night on @BBCRadio3 ‚ÄòHear and Now‚Äô . ‚ÄòSounds like furniture being pushed down a staircase‚Äô - üôå @ourmodernlove üå¥üå¥ ‚ÄòThe Critical Rush‚Äô starts the show linked below :
@BBCRadio3 What matters ; Performance from the heart , vibrations ! aesthetic quality timbre , sensitivity , passion ! It does not matter what you look like :)
@drsarahwalker @BBCRadio3 @Papagenasingers @mckaystout @7digitalCreativ Justcaught the Handel Organ &gt; &gt; &gt; DO FISH OUT Corette 's Opus 26 , and some neglected T . Arne organ Works !! ;-) )
Forget the hours of practice and years of training . For some performers , walking out onto the stage is the hardest part of the job .
@RailtonLucy @Neilluck @BBCRadio3 @ourmodernlove " Sounds like furniture being pushed down a staircase ." What a glorious compliment !
Another blazing day in the garden . The clematis is out . Potting on tomato &amp; rudbeckia plants . @BBCRadio3 in the background . Just need a nice cool drink . #perfectlyrelaxing #gardening
I love listening to Private Passions @BBCRadio3 on a Sunday afternoon .

Private Passions - Lubaina Himid - black British artist @BBCRadio3

@BBCRadio3 ....... has been sublime all day so far üëç
Really enjoying listening to @1lubaina ‚Äòs wise words about ideas , making art , artists and music choices on @BBCRadio3 today Thank you !
" Forget chanting on a mountaintop with bald monks shouting at you ... You can just listen to music and find that same degree of peace and calm that we so desperately need ."

@BBCRadio3 I will assume , though , that James hasn't gone to a mountaintop to spend time chanting with monks .

@BBCRadio3 My blackbirds are more whistle and croak at the end . I think possibly thrush .
@BBCRadio3 Nightingale
@BBCRadio3 Nightingale ‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ÄúYou're an absolute shower ! ‚Äù
Thanks @stjohnscam @BBCRadio3 for #ChoralEvensong this glorious afternoon #DumTransissetSabbatum - utterly ethereal !
@BBCRadio3 From the outline it looks like a Blackbird but the song is not fruity enough so I think it 's a warbler and I'm going to say Nightingale
@BBCRadio3 Would you call Peter Pears Benjamin Britten 's Muse ? Or is the term only applicable to women ?

@BBCRadio3 I just signed up for your ‚Äòclip of the day‚Äô . Thank you ! Brilliant !
Ooh , Matron . Now that @BBCRadio3 tweet could mean one of two very different things , depending on whether that 's " shower " or " shower ".
@IAMKP @BBCRadio3 Catch it on iPlayer . Loved it . If you haven‚Äôt - do it ! üòé
Listened to @BBCRadio3 on my run this morning - Stravinsky , &amp; Mozart . I found it energising ( I usually run with my own thoughts only , but needed motivation post Pembs/Paris to get me back into it) ! It worked üëç #running #motivation
@BBCRadio3 Song thrush
This was on @BBCRadio3 this morning , and has been in my head all day - Robeson 's uniquely thrilling voice , and a gentle , sunny Bank Holiday vibe ...
We asked a cellist to perform a duet with a nightingale , outside , in the woods , in the dead of night . So what was that like ?
Grab some üéß to test your knowledge of the natural world ( and perhaps learn a thing or two ) with a delightfully relaxing #birdsong quiz .
Cello ( Laura Moody ) and nightingales from @BBCRadio3

@BBCRadio3 Beautiful and enchanting . Is there a playlist ?
Morning ! Here‚Äôs George Orwell bathed in sunshine outside BH at 5.39 this morning . It‚Äôs me on @BBCRadio3 this morning ; Gabrieli , Mozart , Bach and Erollyn Wallen in the first hour alone . Do join us !

Breakfast - Monday - Georgia Mann - @BBCRadio3
Lovely Sound The Trumpet on @BBCRadio3 as we're driving to the coast
How lovely to listen to the dulcet tones of @MannGeorgia on this sunny bank holiday morning ! #moreplease @BBCRadio3
@MannGeorgia @BBCRadio3 I am , it almost compensated for working on a BH Monday-until @vijialles dropped the ' vanilla ice cream shortage ' bombshell !
@SharpV50 @BBCRadio3 Your Night with Nightingales last night was beautiful thank you . I drifted in and out as Morpheus kept taking over , but caught most of it . Might listen again
@BBCRadio3 good morning Georgia . Great to hear the Tylman Susato Danserye in it‚Äô s brass incarnation . Many thanks .
üöå How many hours of your life have you spent standing at one ?
@BBCRadio3 lovely to hear Beethoven‚Äôs ninth as a piano peace . Incredibly relaxing
@MannGeorgia @BBCRadio3 Good Morning
@lyeemoon It 's a lovely , sunny morning . I switched immediately to @BBCRadio3 üòä Perhaps they meant they're moving the ' hurty words ' people to actual policing ?? üòÇ
@BBCRadio3 Beautiful nightingale . üíñ Sadly gone from Devon , now .
Thank you so much @elizabethalker for playing ' Waves ' on your magnificent #Unclassified show last night ! @BBCRadio3 @AnnaPhoebe @AVAmusic

@1lubaina @BBCRadio3 Missed it ! Love Fado . Amalia ' For Your Delight ' was one of my Mum 's treasured records when I was a kid .
@MannGeorgia @BBCRadio3 Why is there a statue of George Orwell outside BH ?
Nice to hear the #Nielsen on @BBCRadio3 - first movement of that was my Grade 6 piece so very many years ago .
@BBCRadio3 at last a female presenter who speaks without a laughy undercurrent to her intonation , liking Georgina Mann this morning , ' Keeping it Real', thankyou
@DSinck @BBCRadio3 @vijialles I could just imagine the worried faces across the nation after that story !
@DinahSW @BBCRadio3 Mostly I listen to Mariza but will check out Amalia
@1lubaina @BBCRadio3 Yes I listen to Mariza more now - saw her in Manchester a while ago and she was fabulous .
@Castles73 @BBCRadio3 How many instruments were you playing ???
@itsMr_med @BBCRadio3 And you Andrew - have an excellent BH
The sound accompanying human life for millennia ...
@BBCRadio3 While today is indeed Tchaikovsky ‚Äòs 178th birthday it is also Brahms‚Äôs 185th .
@BBCRadio3 the Copland will always remind me of the first time I played it , from the atrium gallery at Cheltenham‚Äôs Pittville Pump Rooms . My playlist suggestion ? The piece that followed it on that occasion - Vaughan Williams Tallis Fantasia , giving the strings their turn to shine
@BBCRadio3 perhaps more Copland today , The Quiet City or The Promise of Living . Two wonderful pieces full of his unique musical voice ?
@BBCRadio3 I always confuse this with Strauss ' Thus Spake Zarathrusa( ? ) . So that 's my suggestion .
Looking forward to Lily Boulanger as Composer of the Week @BBCRadio3 @DonaldMacleod01 every noon this week .
@BBCRadio3 how about another well-used fanfare - the opening to Also sprach Zarathustra ( Strauss) ?
Tune in to @BBCRadio3 and @BBCInTune at 5pm today to hear Jeremy Rose , @rosemaryashe and @stefanbednar talking about #JSTTonight and singing from the show !
@Jendscott @BBCRadio3 Love it !
@gill_ashworth @BBCRadio3 I did a 3 Min recording but couldn‚Äôt upload it . So beautiful ! Love living here :-)
@Jendscott @BBCRadio3 It‚Äôs just so relaxing !
@gill_ashworth @BBCRadio3 It is . Even at 4.15 am üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
We feel you deserve a rather special musical mini-break ...
So , Bernstein‚Äôs Prelude , Fugue and Riffs immediately sprang to mind , @BBCRadio3 , similar brassy opening , but musically ‚Äòevolved‚Äô !
@BBCRadio3 ' Fanfare ' was used at the 1976 olympics ; my earliest Olympic memory was the fabulous ' Tokyo Melody ' by Helmut Zacharias . Hearing it again would be lovely .
@BBCRadio3 @WhatNowDoc
@Jendscott @BBCRadio3 I‚Äôm going to try and upload this as my alarm , will keep you posted !
@richardddevine @BBCRadio3 Well done , Richard . You‚Äôre absolutely right . I‚Äôll step outside and listen to some now . üòò
@BBCRadio3 following a theme of music that has been interpreted by Emerson lake and palmer how about the tocvata from Ginasera 's first piano concerto

@BBCRadio3 Here 's a handy guide
@BBCRadio3 @JonesTheMusic @houghhough I think Marin Alsop said that too
He murdered his wife and her lover , was tried for witchcraft and dabbled in sadomasochism .
Turned on @BBCRadio3 , some large scale orchestral dribbling going on , with an echo of the Adagietto of Mahler 5 but also some tone-poemy stuff like early Strauss . So who is it , Dickie or Gus ? On looking , it 's the latter , no . 9 ...
@larkingrumple @DevieilheSabine @wigmore_hall @BBCRadio3 Oh ! They did a marvelous recital here in NYC ! Wonderful musical partnership .
@andrewCDmcg @wigmore_hall @DevieilheSabine @BBCRadio3 Astonishing good recital , not that I expected anything less .
@Stephdegout @DevieilheSabine @wigmore_hall @BBCRadio3 Same program as NYC ?
@1lubaina @BBCRadio3 yes that really came across - great choice in studio listening music !

Why should orchestral musicians be better off than jazzers ? Is classical music the top of the cultural tree ? Should the dole phone line play Vivaldi ? Is it OK to like Wagner if he was a Nazi ?
@Psycho_Sonic_C @BBCRadio3 Yes , and how good Shakespeare was at expressing the intensity and insanity of jealousy as also in Othello .

@JohnBaker1975 Is sublime . Seeing as how it was @BBCRadio3 introduced me to it a few months ago I can't grumble , but they can reach me on here any time .
@BBCNOW @TheBrangwyn @BBCRadio3 A very good concert thanks to Tasmin &amp; BBCNOW . üëçüòäüéº
@robinince @DrMatthewSweet @BBCRadio3 It is indeed , my apologies . Let us hope then they played the Adagio by John Murphy and did not listen to me :)
Listening to #LateJunction with the awesome @imaxreinhardt @reducedlisten @BBCRadio3 and can definitely say music for children never sounded like this when I was at school ! Would have been great if it had though . #NewMusicNewThinking
@johnshea63 @BBCRadio3 @imaxreinhardt Tuned .
Bhusi Mlongo warns against ignoring your parents .... #WeBabaOmncane #LateJunction @BBCRadio3
@BBCRadio3 @imaxreinhardt Strong titfer game Max !
#TheLittleChildren #AfricanChildren #LateJunction is bubbling @BBCRadio3
@JahDuran @BBCRadio3 has to be done check the headgear on #Aswad @BBCRadio3 #LateJunction
@Dinosaur_band @AllAboutJazz @EditionRecords @MercuryPrize @KingsPlace @BBCRadio3 @CheltJazzFest @conorchaplin @ElliotGalvin @CDPlayaa @LauraJurd Great new album , see you on Thursday‚Äòs @xjazzberlin in Lido Berlin .
@imaxreinhardt @BBCRadio3 That is a robust line up of hats . And not a sleng teng in sight .
@imaxreinhardt The mix-tape has spread from @BBCRadio3 #LateJunction to In Tune to Music Planet , so should blind-tasting be imported from wine , etc . ? Verity presents , but is it Nick 's pick ?
@imaxreinhardt @BBCRadio3 Your man front centre there ( is it Brinsley ? ) looks like he would have made a good reincarnation of Dr Who .
@THEAGENTAPSLEY @BBCRadio3 truly hypnagogic !
@imaxreinhardt @BBCRadio3 And , I guess that there 's a long history of that : Fritz Kreisler knew that it was best to represent that his encores were the compositions of others , and there are Anne , Emily and Charlotte ?
Ah , but that would characterize such lovely transmissions , @imaxreinhardt , as @BBCRadio3 #LateJunction itself - long may they ! :)
@imaxreinhardt @BBCRadio3 Not to mention ( but , of course , one has to ) : The works of the poet Ossian [ Ois√≠n ] - or , rather , largely of James Macpherson Though , in their own right , said to be good anyway ?
@DrMatthewSweet @BBCRadio3 You know who .
@BBCRadio3 Lovely piece of Britten for clarinet . Little reminiscences of the quartet for Auntie , Ellen and the Nieces in Grimes I think ...
happy memories of the Dutch Pancake House in Manchester . Gone in the interests of progress . @BBCRadio3
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 I never went there but I still miss seeing it when I‚Äôm waiting for the tram at St Peter‚Äôs Square .
Nigel Kennedy and Alex Dankworth playing Ellington on @BBCRadio3 right now - grew up hearing this in the house , lovely start to the day
After some strangled-cat jazz from Nigel Kennedy , now we are being given the theme tune to Vertigo . Is @bbcradio3 trying to get us out of the house early today ?
Bernard Herrmann‚Äôs Vertigo Suite plays @BBCRadio3 breakfast &amp; I‚Äôve suddenly developed an ominous feeling about the day ahead ...
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Aw ... @colin_jagger has many happy memories of it too and @SarahGreinig would probably be there instead of string practice :)
. @BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny quirky video of distinctive sounds of the NL for Dutch Day A lot of things take me there instantly : Tram bells dinging , cyclists shouting " Kijk uit " ( Kiyk out ! ) church cantillons , smell of loompjes ( spring rolls ) at Nordemaarkt
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Don't be put off from broadening the repertoire Petroc . It 's great to hear Vertigo soundtrack , and Nigel Kennedy this AM .
@BBCRadio3 @MichaelRosenYes It sounds like a fantastic programme , but if it‚Äôs being aimed at kids why is it being aired at 11pm ???!
@BBCRadio3 @MichaelRosenYes same thing : we see children reading their own @makeourbook books over and over . Kids love to read kids‚Äô writing .
@BBCRadio3 Loved " The Work Song " just now , thanks ! Saw the Alec Dankworth Quartet a few mths ago , inc . daughter Emily . Fantastic !
@thequentinletts @BBCRadio3 Heartily agree ! We have largely abandoned @bbcradio3 for the Belgian online station Klara_continuo which has wonderful music minus the inane chat .
More over-analysis of #opera on #r4today If it‚Äôs any good , it doesn‚Äôt need explanation or ‚Äòtranslation‚Äô . @bbcmusic @bbcproms @BBCRadio3
Thank you @PetrocTrelawny and @BBCRadio3 that was beautiful #oforthewingsofadove üé∂
How lovely to hear Tom Pickard on @BBCRadio3 this morning . Tom is the son of the much missed Alan whose influence on Manx musical life was huge .
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 More of a curry mile chap myself . Used to pop down there prior to concerts at the Free Trade Hall . Then Cox‚Äôs bar or Tommy Ducks .
@Dan1876 @BBCRadio3 I never miss it . I find it a calming way to start the day .
@thequentinletts @BBCRadio3 It is called dumbing down .
@thequentinletts @BBCRadio3 Yes . It varies tremendously . The evening performances , operas are terrific as can be other music during the day . I'm not always in the car at the right time so I wish my car stereo would save my favourite shows .
Very well worth debating . He 's sneaking more and more listeners away from @BBCRadio4 to @BBCRadio3 - for heaven 's sake , when even that most political of animals @thequentinletts jumps ship ... #ThePowerOfPetroc
Grab some üéß to test your knowledge of üê¶ üé∂ - and perhaps learn a thing or two .
This was fabulous @BBCRadio3 #lateJunction
@PetrocTrelawny Doing good today the Carl Nielsen was great as was Hitchcock‚Äôs composer ! @BBCRadio3 lay off the Elgar though
Tomorrow evening I will be taking part in bbcradio3 live discussion‚Ä¶
@PetrocTrelawny I‚Äôd love to hear some #ustvolskaya a prelude maybe ? @BBCRadio3
@Ianskellyradio3 @BBCRadio3 How did that apostrophe get in there ?
Wowee , my remix of @LUNG_DART 's Wrung Out was played by @elizabethalker on her @BBCRadio3 Unclassified , " delving further into an emerging scene of composers and performers whose music reaches beyond old fashioned and established ideas of classification " &gt;
@wolfsonfdn @BBCRadio3 @britac_news @bickers @DrLindseyFitz @MirandaKaufmann @tlgrady68 Will this be available as a podcast ?
@RGlasbrook @BBCRadio3 Ooh , didn't know about that one - thanks for the tip .
Memory Grandmaster @tedcooke 's guide to remembering everyday things is GENIUS . You will never forget your PIN again .
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Oh no .... Many happy memories
Again @BBCRadio3 ' Through the Night ' getting me through the day .... #nowplaying #iPlayer
This week @BBCRadio3 Lunchtime concert features recordings from @hayfestival 2017 . Yesterday : Adam Walker and James Baillieu play CPE Bach , Mozart and Schubert
@BBCRadio3 Great tweet BTW üòâ
@BBCRadio3 @ISM_music East Sussex CC knows better than Plato . Proposal to axe the small group teaching service to 3500 children and 70 redundancies . And they are supposed to be delivering the National Plan for Music . 11700 have signed the petition #save ESMS
@BBCRadio3 Shame it‚Äôs been programmed for a decidedly un-child friendly time of 11pm .
@BBCRadio3 If you want to hear the Bach live pop along to St Mary‚Äôs Episcopal Cathedral Glasgow at 7.30 pm on Saturday for a free concert to launch the organ restoration fund !!
@BBCRadio3 I think a good piece to follow from Marche au Supplice would be Richard Strauss‚Äôs Till Eulenspiegel‚Äôs Lustige Streiche . I was thinking of the hanging scene when the practical joker went one step too far !
@BBCRadio3 @HunDude Mid-week when many schools have SATs assessments ?
@BBCRadio3 The first 3 notes of the Brahms always recalls ( to me ) Acker Bilk 's " Stranger on the Shore ". Just the laid-back clarinet sound !
@johnshea63 @BBCRadio3 @imaxreinhardt I imagine it 's hard to get a new look going via radio though .
New to me today , @BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny , the composer Alphons Diepenbrock : the Dance of the Nymphs &amp; Apollo 's Epilogue from his Marsyas suite . A Classics teacher who also composed .
The wonderful @dknehans 's track ' Tempest ' from his CD ' Unfinished Earth ' has been featured on @BBCRadio3 Breakfast !! üìªüëèüèª follow the link to hear it again üòç
@BBCRadio3 @imaxreinhardt So good style . Love to all bbc radios , Late junction and Chris

Next Wednesday in Sheffield ( 16 May) : @BBCRadio3 Exposure series featuring Heavy Lifting , @heathen_specs and Jim Ghedi ( free gig ! )
Pianist Federico Colli is on @BBCRadio3 #lunchtimeconcert today with a programme of Mozart and Beethoven recorded at the @hayfestival 2017 . Catch him here from 1pm :
@ChandosRecords @BBCRadio3 @hayfestival He has a real look of the dear departed Phil Lynott .
@BBCRadio3 Do you know , I was listening to this exact same bird this morning , whistling outside + couldn't Work out what it was ..... Yes , a Nightingale did cross my Mind ! -
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 I remember my Uni Challenge team eating there before filming in üò± 2003 .
" It makes us feel as jubilant as the music is ..."
J to Z - Al Foster in concert - @BBCRadio3 . Brilliant train listening !
This afternoon the Lancing College Choir is broadcasting on @BBCRadio3 at 3.30 pm , in the BBC 's long-running series ' Chapel Evensong'. Extremely rare for a school to be asked - so please do tune in . Celebratory music for Ascension !
@BBCRadio3 was lovely ...
@BBCRadio3 well , infact heard 2x Nightingales speak to each other this morning .... It was still dark but I could just about make out what they were saying ?!....
@chrishawtree @BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny Diepenbrock appears regularly on Through the Night ! But it was good to hear this piece of his this morning , which was new to me too .
Looking forward to telling some spine-tingling tales about Victorian surgery at the @BBCRadio3 Free Thinking event tonight @britac_news , and meeting my fellow shortlisted authors for the #WolfsonHistoryPrize ! Follow @wolfsonfdn for more news about the award .
@DrLindseyFitz @BBCRadio3 @britac_news @wolfsonfdn Whoop !
@johnshea63 @BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny Yes , it is marvellous the way in which Through the Night plays such composers . I often wake up and play it , but do not recall him on it .
@BBCRadio3 Adoring the Finzi -really made my full of longing and potential .. gorgeous üòç
@Redpeter99 @PetrocTrelawny The @bbcradio3 breakfast prog with @PetrocTrelawny was great this morning , as is the following programme with @Ianskellyradio3 .
@BBCRadio3 Ian Skelly laments lack of special evensong @LincsCathedral celebrating consecration in 1092 , but bk by Rev JH Srawley ( canon in 1933 ) says Bishop Remigius " didn't live to see " consecration ( according to 12th C scholar de Barri ) but died Ascension Day ( thurs 10th) ...
Lili Boulanger is @BBCRadio3 's #ComposeroftheWeek . Today Donald Macleod considers the relationship between Lili and her elder sister Nadia , and features her only song cycle , ' Clairieres dans le Ciel ' from @nickythespence and @pianomalk . Listen from 12pm :
Thread // A veritable splurge of shows focusing on all things jazz on @BBC6Music and @BBCRadio3 over the last week , including @gillespeterson at the Cheltenham Jazz Festival ... #radioisking #6musicislife #jazz
Having a proper singalong to @BBCRadio3 in the office today ! You‚Äôre missing out @Elanor_Hoskin #purcell #dido #nailedit
Dido &amp; Aeneas @BBCRadio3 is sublime and almost cancels out the weirdness of very cheery window cleaner whistling what sounds like George Formby tunes .
@BBCRadio3 Beautiful ... Purcell .... I Wrote a full 2-3x pages of Gags last Spring ' 17 listening to this full Opera in W1/Lon .... at my Club in W1 , actually ....
Live on @BBCRadio3 #InTune today ! @PatKopViolin performs and chats ahead of Ligeti weekend at @southbankcentre . New album DEUX is out now on @alpha_classics @HarrisonParrott
@Fizgil @BBCRadio3 Maybe the one you mean is Tristes appr√™ts from Rameau 's Castor et Pollux - from 39 ' here - beautiful
At 10pm tonight on @BBCRadio3 I'll be chatting with the amazing @kirstylogan and @MillerMadeline about #folklore , folk tales and myths in our culture ( and in our books) . Why do they still enchant us ? And what 's up with the Disney versions ? Listen here :
I do agree with Ian Skelly on @BBCRadio3 that @LIncscathedral is wonderful - which is why it won #cathedralworldcup !
Dear @bbcradio3 , is the person who puts the ' track ' breaks in the online version of Through the Night away on holiday ? I miss being able to jump back and forth
Radio 3 in Concert - BBC Singers . Handel - @BBCRadio3

@BBCRadio3 Thanks for the hint - enjoying it right now !
@RachelMalik99 @wolfsonfdn @BBCRadio3 @britac_news @bickers @DrLindseyFitz @tlgrady68 I think it will be broadcast on @BBCRadio3 at 10pm on Wednesday 23rd May .
Absolutely loving the Lili Boulanger songs with @pianomalk and @nickythespence - wonderful ! Thank you @DonaldMacleod01 #COTW @BBCRadio3
Forget the hours of practice and years of training . For some performers , walking out onto the stage is the hardest part of the job .
Choral Evensong - Lancing College - @BBCRadio3 - so near ... but wireless it will be ! I have a special predilection for the voluntary üòÅ
Name that bird ! üê¶ üé∂ A delightfully relaxing #birdsong quiz :
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Yes . Quite agree ! Great repertoire this morning , Petroc . More please . On the British music front can we have John Ireland‚ÄôsA Downland Suite please ? The brass band version ?
@BBCRadio3 @drsarahwalker Love that quote about the arts . Are you able to tweet the link to it ? Good morning of music too . üòä
@IMcMillan @BBCRadio3 It was lovely wasn't it Ian ? Your description is so apt .
@andrewCDmcg @ivanhewett @BBCRadio3 Brilliant Brahms
@BBCRadio3 You seem to have overlooked an entire generation of very talented UK game composers . ' Responsive ' + symphonic is hardly new in games . Where have you been the last 20 years ? You're talking to the wrong folks , methinks !
@BBCRadio3 - Martin Handley playing Purcell ' Nymphs and Shepherds ' ( arr . Harty ) this a.m. The scoops on ' away ' are archaic but beautiful . The diction of those 1929 Mancunian Schoolchildren was perfect - &amp; with a lovely Lancashire twang on ' now , now , now , now , now'.
Ahh lovely . @BBCRadio3
Just discovered @BBCRadio3 's #PrivatePassions - what I've been missing .
@victorshannock @BBCRadio3 And Vaughan Williams " Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis " . Hair on the back of your neck stuff .
@andrewCDmcg @ivanhewett @BBCRadio3 And then he wrote his second symphony in about six weeks , I believe .
Here are 29 things that only people who collect pebbles will understand . Trust us on this .
@SophEGray @stevesilberman @BBCRadio3 Thank you - I‚Äôve downloaded it to listen later .
@BBCRadio3 We are guilty as charged
@DuncanWardMusic @BBCPhilharmonic @BBCRadio3 Whoa you were up early !
@drsarahwalker @BBCRadio3 @7digitalCreativ Really enjoyed the programme today @drsarahwalker
@LElschenbroich @BBCPhilharmonic @BBCRadio3 Got to learn the next scores sometime ...!
@CambUP_Music @BBCRadio3 @tomservice Oooh ... looking forward to that ! I have that book and show it to my students . Will @james_hannigan ( who wrote the foreword ) be on the show , too ? One of my favourite composers .
Fascinating to learn from harpsichordist Carole Cerasi @BBCRadio3 that correspondence between Fran√ßois Couperin and JS Bach was lost because the letters were cut up to make lids for pots of jam . Later searches for the documents proved , er , fruitless .
Wonderful programme about the great Francois Couperin with Carole Cerasi @BBCRadio3 Such a stunning music .
Delightful @BBCRadio3 programme with Lucie Skeaping talking to harpsichordist Carole Cerasi about Couperin @lucieskeaping
@jessicaduchen @BBCRadio3 Much discussion about the jam-pot lids here .
@BBCRadio3 #Shakespeare‚Äôs most loved comedy A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S #DREAM in an all-new magical and majestic production lands at the Greenwich Theatre from May 15th - 26th . Over 500 tickets at just ¬£10 ! Do not miss this ...
Great to hear @stevesilberman on @BBCRadio3 's #PrivatePassions earlier today talking about his time listening to #autistic people , his book #Neurotribes &amp; his musical choices : üìª

@CRAE_IOE @stevesilberman @BBCRadio3 It was a repeat but I really enjoyed hearing it again . Loved the music choices too .

Also in my next batch of @BBCRadio3 Through the Night üé∂ is a captivating sequence of Machaut &amp; Arvo P√§rt from the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir ( 14 June ) @EBU_HQ @KerstiKaljulaid @ratasjuri @ukinestonia @estembassyuk @EEinEU @MattiMaasikas @eeBritish @thebaltictimes
Another ( ! ) jewel in the crown of @BBCRadio3 Through the Night is the Herne Early Music Festival/Tage Alter Musik Herne üá©üá™ The 2017 event ( Rebels , Reformers &amp; Revolutionaries ) included a fine concert by NeoBarock which you can hear on 16 June . Herzlichen Dank @wdr3 @Stadt_Herne
@johnshea63 @BBCRadio3 @EBU_HQ @sverigesradio @radiosweden @SwedishPM @margotwallstrom @swedeninuk @UKinSweden @dagensnyheter @DNKultur Always much enjoyed , Through the Night - and I am neither a long-distance truck driver nor on a taxi rank .
Is Music a #UniversalLanguage ? @BBCRadio3 's #TomService discovers " it 's much more powerful than that " in a fascinating " Listening Service " program . We were enthralled by his description that " we live in a multiverse of musical possibilities ." Listen in :
@CRAE_IOE @stevesilberman @BBCRadio3 Listen to us ?! Not only that but he accepts &amp; embraces us ! #autistic people #FabAllies
But first up , hear client @JobbieRack in #MeasureforMeasure on @BBCRadio3 tonight !
" I don't think I like 90% of music . But the 10% I love very much ." The legendary Otomo Yoshihide has only gone and made a mixtape for #LateJunction . Listen here :
An afternoon of paperwork brightened by the beautiful @BBCRadio3 #ChoralEvensong from @GuildCath . We're so blessed by the amazing voice of our cathedral in @CofEGuildford . Thanks to @dieneswilliams @JulieGittoes @CanonAndrewB and all staff at the cathedral for all your hard work .
üéÆ üé∂ In video games , the music has to respond to an infinity of player decisions . So how does that actually work ? @tomservice investigates in #TheListeningService - here 's a sneak preview from @jessicacurry2
What do you do when your musical memory fails ?
. @BBCRadio3 streaming the premiere of TELEKINESIS with @BBCCO @BBCSingers @andrederidder at #queenelizabethhall
" This is the origin of everything ..."
I wonder if this means I can now play @BBCRadio3 at #MarioKart ?
@YehudaShapiro @BBCRadio3 Pity they could not be preserved .
@lucyschaufer @jessicaduchen @BBCRadio3 @WildPlumArts Isn't it customary to make jam by the Bach ?
@manou44 @BBCRadio3 Maybe there was a confit of interests .
@YehudaShapiro @BBCRadio3 Compote le flacon pourvu qu'on ait l'ivresse....

Words and Music - Reconciliation - @BBCRadio3 Where is the list of music played and texts used ?
@BBCRadio3 listening to Words and Music , much moved by the theme of reconciliation , would like to know the names of the poets and musicians I am listening to .
@BBCRadio3 Words and Music is stunning tonight . You've brought the sunshine into the room
This was much fun ! if u missed it don‚Äôt worry bc we doing it again @lsostlukes @BBCRadio3 30 June ( n might even try it a bit faster eheh )
Just seen #isleofdogs . Fitting end to japan #NightBlossoms week @BBCRadio3 . Just brilliant
A particularly fine broadcast now on @BBCRadio3 exploring , through music and poetry , the process of reconciliation , redemption and forgiveness .
Loving the album . Can‚Äôt wait to see you #biggestweekend @BBCRadio3 in Coventry
@spillaneda @BBCRadio3 We could all do with a bitta dat !
@ElizaTMullaney @BBCRadio3 Forgiving oneself is often the most difficult act of reconciliation .
@BBCRadio3 Rumor has it that Karl Richter 's memory once failed him in the middle of an organ recital in which he ( as always ) played everything by heart . Improvising wildly , he instructed someone sitting nearby in the gallery to take his key ring and fetch the score from the boot of his car .
@BBCRadio3 Alas ! I cannot find the playlist for today 's Words and Music ! It is not showing on your website where it usually is !
Honored to be a guest on this rerun of @BBCRadio3 's " Private Passions ", a great radio show , talking about the history of #autism , #NeuroTribes , jazz , Allen Ginsberg , Steve Reich , and much else .
Water-filled porcelain bowls , hydrophones , analogue modular synths and traditional Japanese gagaku ...
@BBCRadio3 When is the play list for the Words and Music on Reconciliation being put online ?
@CRAE_IOE @shannonrosa @stevesilberman @BBCRadio3 I'm an Intersection ...

What , in your opinion , are the most evocative video game soundtracks of the last 40 years ?
@BBCRadio3 Silent Hill &amp; Tomb Raider ( PS1 ) , Mass Effect , Quake ... So many . LSO did a couple of albums of orchestral arrangements too and their version of the Tetris theme is pure joy .
@BBCRadio3 Mozart Requiem , Bioshock Infinite . Traviata &amp; Lucia di Lammermoor , Grand Theft Auto III .

Japanese people have consistently used ghosts and ghost stories to make sense of themselves and their place in the world .
@nphegarty @BBCRadio3 A fine programme . I particularly liked Desmond Tutu 's observation : " Superficial reconciliation can bring only superficial healing ."

@stevesilberman @BBCRadio3 How cool !
Hear this stunning concert on Radio 3 , 7.30 pm , Monday 7 May .
@BBCRadio3 My fave : Arcanum ( of Steamwork etc . ) : vividly creates a late-Victorian/steampunk atmosphere , tinged with mystery , melancholy , and magic , whilst being robust and elegant enough to stand alone as an extended string quartet piece .

@BBCRadio3 @suzyklein A companion piece to An American in Paris might be one by Stravinsky , someone who lived in Paris before becoming an American citizen . Possibly something from one of his ballets ( Petrushka , Firebird , The Rite ) as issued on Pleyel ( of Paris ) piano rolls .

@DrMatthewSweet @BBCRadio3 aged 10 , a tv screening of Slaughterhouse-Five - its fractured out of sequence structure opened my mind to the curious allure of nonlinear time theory , leaving me in a perpetual state of excited bafflement .
@DrMatthewSweet @BBCRadio3 Edith Piaf 's rendition of ' Non , Je ne regrette rien ' in INCEPTION was rather lovely though the stark score that Jerry Goldsmith produced for John Huston 's FREUD really stayed with me ( later turned up in the temp track for the first ALIEN )
@DrMatthewSweet @BBCRadio3 And Melancholia . The world is going to end so what does anything matter . And maybe it'll be quite beautiful if you can learn to love its darkness . Put the economic crisis into perspective for me .

@BBCRadio3 I didn't know that about Cavalleria Rusticana .... hm .. from a Competition that very nearly didn't get entered ! -
@BBCRadio3 thanks for that work by Herbert Howells . One of my favourite British composers . He wrote a piece for brass band called Pageantry . I thought with the Royal Wedding coming up it be good to have this work broadcast ?
@BBCRadio3 What about Haydn‚Äôs Insanae et vanae for #mental health awareness - it is a surprisingly modern text !
Does it matter what musicians wear on stage ? #BBCYoungMusician #podcast
@BBCRadio3 @MannGeorgia Charles Proctor , a teacher of mine at TCL in the ( very ) late 60s spoke about working with Sargent on those Coleridge-Taylor RAH spectaculars . Very popular . Just like operatic stagings of Bach‚Äôs Passions recently . Regular‚ÄùHiawatha‚Äù performances up to 60s .
From stage fright to social media - here 's what we've learned from the #BBCYoungMusician podcast so far .
@BBCRadio3 Handel lived in Brook Street 200yrs earlier ?!....
@BBCRadio3
We're giving Saint-Sa√´ns ' Le Rouet d'Omphale a spin on #EssentialClassics today . What shall we line up next for the playlist ?
@BBCRadio3 Surely you've already got Dvorak 's Golden Spinning Wheel on your list ?
@BBCRadio3 Gretchen am Spinnrade is no less great for being a predictable choice .
@BBCRadio3 Inspired by her magnificent hat , how about Copland 's Lincoln Portrait ?
@BBCRadio3 Dvo≈ô√°k 's gruesome symphonic poem The Golden Spinning Wheel
@BBCRadio3 Schubert 's ' Gretchen at the spinning wheel'. And La jeunesse d'Hercule by saint saens . Ian and Louise on Skye .
@BBCRadio3 1/2 Saint-Sa√´ns always reminds me of Stanford : both brilliant at harmony and counterpoint , and both able to sustain a texture for ages , if both a little conservative ...
Hard at work for exams ? Find your motivation with gently uplifting music that doesn‚Äôt always go the way you expect ...
@BBCRadio3 Really interesting piece on Essential Classics Just now about pencils . Didn‚Äôt know a pencil could be that exciting . ü§£ü§£ü§£
@BBCRadio3 Have you beautiful people spun Tchaikovsky 's Sleeping Beauty yet ?
@BBCRadio3 You always roll out 4 Last Songs when playing Jessie Norman . It is in my opinion the second worse version of the Strauss masterpiece whose genius makes Normans attempt bearable . Why not play something she sang well ? P.S. Kiri 's version is by far the worst of the top 10
@BBCRadio3 love that music after the Brahms Op . 116 . What was it ?
@BBCRadio3 Hello . Do you know how many semi- and finalists in Young Musician of the Year are from state schools ? From memory , there 's only ever been one state school winner .

@BBCRadio3 Handel‚Äôs Chaconne in G major would make a nice follow because Handel also wrote some very good harpsichord Suites .
@BBCRadio3 I always feel " Sheep may safely graze " goes well with the Air . To go more modern we could use a piece by Michael Nymen perhaps . Though the Erik Satie already seems to work with the Air ! @eusabyus
@BBCRadio3 AFter that Bach do TRY attributed Telemann Horn Concerto=TWV43 :D 8 &gt; &gt; Listen OUT for the same theme !!!! Provocative Tease !; - &gt;

@BBCRadio3 Messiaen : Le merle bleu . All of it .
@BBCRadio3 Only one thing to follow a Haydn quartet . Another Haydn quartet . Ian on Skye .
@BBCRadio3 I would mention a certain piece by Vaughan Williams but that‚Äôs a bit obvious perhaps üòâ How about Handel‚Äôs Cuckoo &amp; The Nightingale ?
@BBCRadio3 After Haydn 's " Lark " Quartet , &amp; in similar morning mode , try his equally exquisite " Sunrise " Quartet Op76/4 . All Haydn 's quartets are miracles .

@BBCRadio3 How about Liszt 's transcription of Schubert 's " Hark , hark , the lark " in keeping with the bird theme ?
Special shout-out to Wagner fans : see if you can spot the bits RW cribbed . It 's not a tough assignment : some of them are gobsmackingly obvious ... Weber 's rarely performed fantasy opera Oberon from Bavarian State Opera :

@BBCRadio3 well , this is a little annoying , ' Un ballo in Maschera ' is on , yet I can't seem to get very much reception on either my Smartphone Radio , nor On-line ! - ....
Practice DOES make perfect , memorising music is hard and it 's completely normal to not want to practice . Here 's what we've learned from the @BBCYoungMus #podcast so far :

@BBCRadio3 I‚Äôm sorry but @FishPeopleFC was singing with birds 13 years ago !
@BBCRadio3 no woman no cry on cello , it 's beautiful !
@BBCRadio3 gosh Martin thank you for that Ravel . I'd never hear the Herbie Hancock version before ... it was stunning !
@BBCRadio3 First time I've heard the Herbie Hancock Ravel Piano Concerto , I hope it 's the last . What a fiasco . A beauiful piece destroyed by an ego ! Please erase all copies of this offense to art .
So the @BBCProms are officially on sale . If you didn't get the tickets you wanted check back as there may always be returns . And of course there'll be promming tickets available on the day :

@BBCRadio3 What a lovely La Mer . Not heard that before .
@BBCRadio3 Here 's one for you . Pictures . Originally a piano piece , then orchestrated . The first version that I recall was by Emerson , Lake and Palmer ! I loved the orchestration and then didn't hear the original version for many a year , and had to un-learn my ear . All 3 are brill !
" It makes us feel as jubilant as the music is ..."
@BBCRadio3 @ClassicFM really should pay attention to one of the world 's best guitarists @EwanDobson
Who 's excited about the @BBCYoungMus 2018 final tonight ? The competition 's accompanying podcast has been exploring what it means to be a young musician in 2018 . Here 's what we've learned so far : #BBCYoungMusician

@BBCRadio3 for today‚Äôs ‚Äòfollowon‚Äô piece may I suggest another operatic work , by Wagner ? His Die Meistersinger Von N√ºrnberg Overture ? A complete contrast to the Puccini but all about singing , being the theme here ?
@BBCRadio3 I think you should play ' Home ' from Les Miserable , after the Humming chorus .

" I can't sing a note ..."
Does it matter what musicians wear on stage ? The #BBCYoungMusician #podcast team think so ...
@BBCRadio3 Who says that Bach Ravel etc in the background helps concentrate on writing an essay ? What a load of tosh . Reference sources to hand , and a very quiet place for max concentration . Slight headache ? .. take a drug . Difficult essay topic ? .. oh you poor thing you need a mixtape .
@BBCRadio3 New project bringing together sound and photography across 34 countries launches today - thought you might find it interesting ! #soundphotography

‚úè Notes to help you take notes ...
" I relearned the violin completely at 35 but gave up playing when I was 55 ... You can't be on the stage playing trio sonatas at 75 !" Reinhard Goebel on playing with focal dystonia and turning his hand to conducting .

@lightonthewaves @BBCRadio3 @ivanhewett @BBCiPlayer Well I certainly didn't see that coming . If Ivan 's barely mentions my current fave @andris_nelsons version , at least he chucked us over for a brave choice . Furtw√§ngler is uniquely wonderful #BackToMono

Tune in tonight at 10pm for the world premiere of " The Bad Feelings Rainbow " by @qasimnaq on @BBCRadio3 :
A remarkable concert from @BBCSO tonight for @BBCRadio3 . Outstanding performance of John Adams‚Äô The Wound Dresser from @MBJFarnsworth . The @BBCSingers shone through in the final work Ross Harris‚Äô Face . A haunting programme and sombre memorial to the First World War .

@BBCRadio3 @Forrest_Burgess A thousand thank yous for posting this . I love BBC radio , Astronomy and the wonderful voice of the giant Brian Blessed .
@BBCRadio3 He was that and more ! üéº
@BBCRadio3 Broadening on from previous thought abt unsophisticated musical taste in rock/pop , is there such a thing as bad taste in classical music ? Or is it just a ? of fashion and changing taste ? Thoughts , please ! @IanskellyRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny
@BBCRadio3 please play ( much ) less Bach on the organ and more from the coffee shop . Thank you ! #bachbefore7
@BBCRadio3 Good morning Petroc , no need to apologise for playing organ music - just don't play it . Best , Mark in St Leonards-on-Sea
@BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny How about Litanies , by Jehan Alain , which is my favourite organ work . I love Thomas Trotter 's recording . And if you have time , there 's Giles Swayne 's Riff-raff , which is fun .
@BBCRadio3 glorious hums of Pooh !
@BBCRadio3 #MusicPlanet tmrw Friday 11pm to hear these lovely people and more ... @boden_jon @angeliquekidjo @elizacarthy and more .
@BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny Organ music request . Anything played on the magnificent Cavaill√©-Coll instrument of St Ouen , Rouen . Fantastic/famous pedal Bombarde . Suggest Vierne ‚ÄòCarrillon de Westminster‚Äô as a starter played by Ben van Oosten . Thanks .
The #EssentialClassics playlist is looking to the skies for inspiration ... What would you like to hear after Vaughan Williams ' The Lark Ascending ?
@BBCRadio3 Messiaen , ‚ÄòOiseaux Exotiques‚Äô .
@BBCRadio3 Sibelius ' violin concerto . Sibelius was a violinist and knew the instrumental range the violin was capable of , an ideal person to write for it . Hence the wonderful concerto . Ian on Skye .
@BBCRadio3 Daquin Le Coucou played by George Malcolm
@BBCRadio3 Anything by ' SKY ' would do nicely . The group created a brilliant album of Mozart 's works at the Academy of St Martin's-in-the-Fields with Sir Neville Marriner . CD 832 908-2
@BBCRadio3 The Swan by Saint-Saens . This version , with Hanna Chang .
@BBCRadio3 perhaps @Ianskellyradio3 doesn't know that school terms are different in Scotland : half term is long gone . Summer term ends at the end of June , and Autumn term starts the middle of August .
@BBCRadio3 Messiaen/ Des Canyons aux √©toiles .
@BBCRadio3 Messiaen , Petites Esquisses D'Oiseaux. Failing that , Rameau La Poule , and Le Rappel des Oiseaux
@BBCRadio3 what better way for a companion piece to this than Respighi‚Äôs Suite The Birds ?
@BBCRadio3 How about Michael Tippet‚Äôs Concerto for Double String Orchestra to follow the RVW ? The same sense of nostalgia , and the rich string sound ?
@BBCRadio3 the forest bird from Act 2 of Siegfried to go with The Lark Ascending
@BBCRadio3 After the lark ascending how about Prokoviev‚Äôs bird from Peter and the Wolf ?
@BBCRadio3 suggestion Britten . Four Sea Interludes . A maritime version of Lark assending .. perhaps ?
@BBCRadio3 To complement VW 's Lark ( I wept for the beauty the first time I heard it ) what about his Serenade to Music . Both are responses to English poetry , and the Serenade has another luscious violin part .
@BBCRadio3 Prolong the bliss at the end by seguing without applause into 4'33 " by John Cage . Alternatively , shift the focus northward , " Land of the Mountain and Flood " by Hamish Maccunn .
@BBCRadio3 Rebecca Clarke 's Viola Sonata . Written at a similar time to the Vaughan Williams and sounds English with it 's folk influences . It 's a real exploration of what the viola can do - perhaps to be expected considering that Clarke herself was a viola player !
@BBCRadio3 #essentialclassicsplaylist Morning Ian . Surely George Butterworth Banks of Green Willow . English pastoral music at it‚Äôs finest .
@BBCRadio3 The obvious ( perhaps too obvious ) follow-on from #TheLarkAscending is George Butterworth 's #BanksofGreenWillow . Another beautiful rural summer 's day , but still overshadowed by war . Of course , Butterworth never came home from the Somme .
@BBCRadio3 May I suggest Tit-willow from the Mikado ? #playlist
@BBCRadio3 Another haunting , solo instrumental piece , inspired by a bird and highly evocative at a critical time in a country 's history : The Swan of Tuonela . #EssentialClassics

" It 's nearly time we had a little less respect for the dead , and a little more regard for the living ." Sean O'Casey 's comedy masterpiece Juno and the Paycock :
@BBCRadio3 Listening to Puccini 's ' Il trittico ' -I adore Puccini but not sure how sensible it is I listen to full Opera ... Puccini always has me in sheds of / far too many tears !.. My Chest has been doing so much better these past days that perhaps it 's unsensible ... Yet -- ha/hm ...

@BBCRadio3 The Paysant Cantata , BWV 212 , has a soprano aria that reminds the follia . Lots of Spanish dances too , obviously . The folia by Geminiani is vey , very similar to Corelli's, so no sense to repeat .
@BBCRadio3 how about another set of variations to follow today , in the form of Handel‚Äôs Harmonious Blacksmith , or even variation 18 from Rachmaninoff‚Äôs Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini ?
@bbcradio3 I‚Äôm absolutely loving this morning‚Äôs Corelli piece ! My tip for someone who enjoys this music : listen to anything by Vivaldi . #EssentialClassics
@BBCRadio3 Corelli ? Boring ? Someone needs to be sent to the naughty step .
@BBCRadio3 How about Boccherini La musica notturna delle strade di Madrid , specifically the Ritirata ( original , not the Berio )
@BBCRadio3 You do realise Michala Petri is one of the leading recorder players of this generation ? Her own performance of the Tartini is superb . Stop being sniffy about recorders - it‚Äôs just ignorant .
What do these guys have in common ? They all used the Folia theme in one of their compositions , as did Corelli , whose version is kicking off suggestions for the #EssentialClassics playlist today . Let us know what you want to hear next !

@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 No , what really freaked him out was the Burberry baseball hat , Staffordshire Bull Terrier and pint of lager .
This Friday , @BBCSingers and @sjeannin perform this gem alongside Dixit Dominus . Live on @BBCRadio3 at 7:30 pm presented by @drsarahwalker .
He murdered his wife and her lover , was tried for witchcraft and dabbled in sadomasochism .
@BBCRadio3 Jaysus ! Quite the character ! üòØ
Ep 4 of @bbcyoungmus podcast looks at memorising music . Do you find this : a ) terrifying üò± b ) liberating ü¶Ñ c ) both ü§Ø Listen/subscribe now :
@DrMatthewSweet @BBCRadio3 There is nothing quite like the sublime score from the Banishment by Andrey Dergachev
Take a journey down the river Vltava with two movements from Ma Vlast , Smetana 's patriotic symphonic poem about his homeland .
@BBCRadio3 Because violence against women , with a few hundred years gap , is a great marketing strategy ?
@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 I‚Äôm very much here to support Kathy wearing a tracksuit
@JFDavidson1964 So glad you enjoyed it Jonathan ! Listen out for @aliciakopf on @BBCRadio3 #TheVerb , and for a @GuardianBooks interview , both coming very soon !
@PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 Imagines smurf patterned smoking jacket and bugs bunny slippers ....
@BBCRadio3 Couldn't tweet earlier ( driving and tweetig don't mix ) but Sibelius Symphony #5 , Rattle and Birmingham Symphony Orchestra just before noon had me brimming with tears of emotion . Beautiful . Thank you .
@Jim936 @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 me too . I think it was the style and elan that she brought to her wearing of it that prompted my response .
@PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 Someone clocked me once for wearing jogger shorts to work . ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not very smart casual ! ‚Äù I‚Äôm not on camera , I work six floors up and only pop down to the Newsroom or 2nd when I‚Äôm bringing BBC folk cupcakes .
have spent a bit too long indoors today with @BBCRadio3 and just heard the verse of turn of the millennium classic " I want it that way " in Hindemith 's Der Schwanendreher so maybe I should go for a walk
@StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 Lately I'm re-appreciating the E-flat piano trio . THAT has to be one of the greatest chamber music masterpieces , along with the cello quintet ( of course ! ) . ' Truly , in this Schubert there dwells a divine spark !'
@Jim936 @PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 Do they still let you in to the newsroom ? My pass doesn‚Äôt work there any more . Apparently I might be a security risk . Moi !
@ANethsingha @SJCChoir @BBCRadio3 @3 @BBCSingers Howells Gloucester .. my ABSOLUTE fave !! I shall try and listen ...
The Los Angeles Philharmonic horns appear live on @BBCRadio3 this morning at 9am PDT ! Tune in :

@JamesRoriston @BBCRadio3 @elizabethalker Like you , I hope that #Unclassified never stops . It‚Äôs a joy to keep on discovering new and exciting artists . I‚Äôve found most of them #Bandcamp and have made frequent additions to my collection . #bbcradio3
@hawkino1960 @BBCRadio3 @elizabethalker Yes same ... @Spotify for me and some CD 's on my wishlist for when I revisit the UK
Behind the scenes of today‚Äôs broadcast of the Los Angeles Philharmonic horns on @bbcradio3 . üìª üéº #LAPhilTour
@JamesRoriston @BBCRadio3 @elizabethalker @Spotify I should make more use of my #Spotify account but there are only so many hours in a day ! It‚Äôs good to always be playing catch-up and adding other names to the eternal list . Addiction indeed ! #Unclassified #bbcradio3
@nicholascollon @TheCBSO @BBCRadio3 I was totally enthralled by this last night - I nearly burnt my sweet potato chips ! Bravo , @nicholascollon and @TheCBSO !
@gwilymbowen @BBCRadio3 Maybe lean into it ?!? Seems like your close to some sort of break through !!
Tippett described his evocative work as a song without words for orchestra , inspired by journeys to Lake Retba in Senegal .
@hawkino1960 @BBCRadio3 @elizabethalker @Spotify Oh so true ... undoubtedly there will be more gems on #Unclassified for our playlists :-) ... it 's #RadioGold
@torkardensemble @BBCRadio3 Ours ! We pronounce it better !

@StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 Fond memories of arguments with my sister while playing that ... I love the Britten/Richter recording , fistfuls of wrong notes but they are clearly having a fabulous time .
Well @BBCRadio3 this is quite some concert . Ravel Tombeau and now John Adams ' The Wound Dresser . Thanks for this , for staying true and for all you've given over the years !
@LaraEPoe @MakingMusic_UK @PRSforMusic @soundandmusic @BBCRadio3 @CreativeScots @GioJMusic It‚Äôs a fab scheme if you have time to do it üòä
@HayleyJenkins21 @MakingMusic_UK @PRSforMusic @soundandmusic @BBCRadio3 @CreativeScots @GioJMusic Thanks ! Yes , I've heard good things about it üôÇ
A pioneer in extended vocal technique and a composer of vocal and instrumental music ...
@hannahcfrench @BBCRadio3 Caught up with your wonderful programme ‚Äú24 Violons du Roi‚Äù on the #BBCRadio3earlymusic podcast . Just terrific üëçüëçüëç Thank you !
Blimey . Have just been listening to John Adams‚Äôs The Wound Dresser on @BBCRadio3 . What a phenomenal piece ‚Äì can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never heard it before .
@BBCRadio3 @BBCYoungMus Awesome ! The sign of a true musician , not one that feels the need to get it all right all the time . üíúüéπüéº
@gavinplumley @BBCRadio3 @BBCInTune Sorry , I know I've long since achieved Grumpy Old Man status , but that poor excuse of a programme , which I happened to overhear tonight for the first time in ages , is enough to send me to The Archers ... All this playlist stuff drives me mad !
@LucyNoakes1 @stephenjbrooke @BBCRadio3 " Thank you for coming back to me "
Tuned into @BBCRadio3 @BBCiPlayerRadio #HearAndNow w/ @Tyondai , #QasimNaqvi , #EdgardVarese &amp; @miracalix . I've not listened to this show before , so let 's see what 's in the bag ! Also , it 's the start of the #LateJunction week - not sure who 's on yet . : )
@Matthew_C_Rye @gavinplumley @BBCRadio3 @BBCInTune The 6.30 Composer of the Week was a perfect piece of scheduling by @BBCRadio3 . Missed horribly .
@_paullay @gavinplumley @BBCRadio3 @BBCInTune Indeed . I often used to listen to both broadcasts .
Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis from #thebarbican on @BBCRadio3 . Sublime !
Beautiful on @BBCRadio3 Andr√© Caplet WWI victim .
Weird folk &amp; hauntology on #LateJunction tonight with @SharpV50 @reducedlisten @BBCRadio3 Sounds like a lot of fun . #NewMusicNewThinking
Isn't it time something was done about this ...? @spconnolly @wilde @BBCRadio3 @bbcradio4
@MarkJDoran @spconnolly @BBCRadio3 @BBCRadio4 BBC is so dumbed down it is in special measures . The ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù on R4 is another puke making example .
@wilde @spconnolly @BBCRadio3 @BBCRadio4 Yes ! The BBC 's state-approved comedy ! ( If only we had Victor here ! He 's always in our thoughts ... @TVOFFAL )
@StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 Always love hearing a non-pianist ( or someone not known for being a pianist even if they do play ) comment about the piano repertoire in such positive terms
@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 In reality , it 's the only sensible thing to wear .
Free Thinking - America : Inequality &amp; Race - @BBCRadio3
370 miles/1000 miles done . Tonight 's trot listening to Jazz Now - Julian Lage - @BBCRadio3
@ANethsingha @SJCChoir @BBCRadio3 @3 @BBCSingers Now , if you have the Welsh version I‚Äôd love to hear it !
Slow radio - Nightingales @BBCRadio3 presented by @SharpV50 - 7th May 00:30 - feat . @samamidon &amp; @samleesong amongst the musicians &amp; wildlife
All manner of strange seasonal sonic imaginings for you tonight #LateJunction Come find us at 11pm @BBCRadio3 #MayDay
Free Thinking - America : Inequality &amp; Race - @BBCRadio3
Listening on @BBCRadio3 to @sarahchurchwell being absolutely fascinating on ‚Äòthe American Dream‚Äô . Her new book is obviously a must read in the age of Trump and the American Firsters .
Wyrd folk and hauntology enthusiast Stephen Prince from @yearinthcountry joins @SharpV50 on #LateJunction for a May Day wander through the spectral fields ...
If @gidcoe and @BBCWorldTonight could both move to @BBCRadio3 then I'm pretty sure I wouldn't ever need to change radio stations again . And Desert Island Discs , obvs .
@StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 Heartily agree . At the very least the finest piano duet ever written .
@BBCRadio3 Is it Michael Gove ?
The only way to finish May Day - a little hauntology with @BBCRadio3 #latejunction
@ProfKatyShaw you have got to hear this , Katy . A May 1 celebration of music &amp; hauntology with @BBCRadio3 &amp; @SharpV50 #latejunction
Late Junction - Sleepless in Tokyo - @BBCRadio3
A 15 minute mellifluous meditation to music‚Äôs magnificence c/o @ChrisWood_Music and @BBCRadio3 - utterly worth a listen :
Afternoon Concert tomorrow 2pm BBC Singers @BBCRadio3 includes my setting of George Herbert‚Äôs Heaven written for @IpswichMusic @EditionPetersUK @BBCSingers @RHULChapelChoir
" Quietly unsettling " #latejunction #bbcradio3 Best show on radio .
A seminal compilation and second choice of @yearinthcountry #nowplaying @BBCRadio3 #LateJunction ü§©
See what *a total fucking mess* @BBCRadio3 is in ...? Radio 3 needs to be taken away from the BBC : they're not competent to run it .
Loving the selections by @yearinthcountry on #LateJunction right now on @BBCRadio3 Some personal favourites there from Trader Horne and @GhostBoxRecords
And the final offering of ' otherly pastoralism ' from @yearinthcountry #nowplaying @BBCRadio3 #LateJunction üôè
@SharpV50 @yearinthcountry @BBCRadio3 Wow . Just wow . Great soundtrack to an incredible film . Peter Strickland movies are a touchstone to us hauntology types .
@phildosopher @StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 So great to hear you mention the finale of the trio . Yes , it 's stunning . The soft high piano decoration over the return of the cello 's second movement theme . One of the great moments in western music !
@andrewfurlow @kj_funk @BBCRadio3 This is great ! Beautifully written and read . Assumed it would say ' Get some milk ' or ' Do you mind , some of use have work in the morning ' but no . How precious those memories are . ‚ù§Ô∏è
@ANethsingha @LNethsingha @SJCChoir @BBCRadio3 @3 @BBCSingers Now , Jeremy .......
@RoundwoodsWorld @BBCRadio3 Thanks Sidney - so glad you enjoyed it ! Reckon they were a pretty lively bunch ...
Air ' He was despised ' from the oratorio ' Messiah ' - George Frideric Handel - @BBCRadio3
Through the Night - John Shea presents music from around Europe , including a Late Night BBC Prom - @BBCRadio3
@sweaverphoto @StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 Franz wrote so many of those moments . Have always especially loved the slow movt of the last great B flat piano sonata . I visited his grave in Vienna and someone had written the first page out BEAUTIFULLY by hand and left it with flowers and a note simply saying ‚ÄòBeloved Master‚Äô .
@ANethsingha @SJCChoir @BBCRadio3 @3 @BBCSingers Dear Andrew , I trust that they will be sung in the language in which they were written . If not , why not sing all Latin Masses in English ? xxx
Age is catching up when you don't have patience for mainstream radio , and Spotify won't do it anymore . It 's now @BBCRadio3 #amlistening
Concerto for harp and orchestra in C major - Fran√ßois‚ÄêAdrien Bo√Øeldieu - @BBCRadio3
@phildosopher @StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 I've often wished that I could somehow greet the spirits of Schubert and Mozart , to engage them in conversation , and to bow down in front of them .
Always enjoy Respighi‚Äôs Pines and Fountains . Movie music for a film you script yourself . @BBCRadio3
Late Junction - Verity Sharp with Stephen Prince - @BBCRadio3 stroll soundtrack : a vividly haunted edition of Late Junction for Mayday .
@TrollULike @BBCRadio3 Not visible . Have you got Ed syndrome ?
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 YES #brandenburg2 üôèüèºüé∂üíÉ
@BBCRadio3 I'd be more comfortable with a focus on Rome if it was all played by the Liverpool philharmonic ...
@clemencybh @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 It *is* one of the most joyful pieces of music .
Have been lobbying @PetrocTrelawny to play ' I Know Him So Well ' on @bbcradio3 breakfast this morning ... but he just gives me THAT LOOK
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 It 's a seriously wet morning in Manchester !
@BachChor @clemencybh @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 I‚Äôm a #Brandenburg3 man myself ...

@PetrocTrelawny beautiful this @BBCRadio3
@kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 stop that now . Though it is done brilliantly on stage by @cassidyjanson @alexandramusic
Pines of Rome on @BBCRadio3 this morning . First heard at a Prom when I went with my daughter many years ago . Now a favourite .
@PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 @cassidyjanson @alexandramusic
#Brunel music on @BBCRadio3 this morning from ( totally unknown to me ) F . L . Dunkin Wedd : Three Brunel Crossings . Really enjoyed it .
@RobinComms @PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 @cassidyjanson @alexandramusic
@PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 @cassidyjanson @alexandramusic Glad you eschewed . But what you're playing now is wonderful . Takes me back to a boat ride on the Mississippi .
@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 I Know Him So Well though ... ‚ù§Ô∏è
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 my Favourite Jerome K Jerome quote : " I like work ; it fascinates me . I can sit and look at it for hours "
@PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 @cassidyjanson @alexandramusic Oh go on Petroc . We know you want to .
@David_Oakes @ChrisWood_Music @BBCRadio3 Thank you . I can understand how this hymn had such an effect on the young Mr . Wood . As well as being one of the most beautiful of hymns it is certainly the most spine chilling !
@PetrocTrelawny @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 @cassidyjanson @alexandramusic It was a steamboat equipped with a waterwheel . I remember the captain being very proud of that - and pointing out poor imitations slightly disparagingly on the river .
@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Fear not-it looks like he 's off duty on Monday and @MannGeorgia might be more amenable !
@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 I think you should keep trying , after all , he said in the Standard yesterday that ‚Äòthere is space to celebrate that great tradition of musical theatre too‚Äô . Maybe there should be a ‚ÄòBarbara Dickson before 8‚Äô slot ?
ICYMI There are still 13 days left to catch snippets of last month 's Eavesdropping symposium on the @BBCRadio3 iplayer #oxfordhouse #eavesdroppinglondon #classicalmusic #bethnalgreen #eastlondon
@DSinck @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 @MannGeorgia I will start work on her IMMEDIATELY
Couldn't agree more ! @BBCRadio3
@kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 BD 's version of Another Suitcase in Another Hall . Gets me every time .
Anthony Payne 's setting of Edward Thomas 's poem Adlestrop next @BBCRadio3 - the now defunct Gloucestershire station where an express unexpectedly stopped on June 24th 1914 .
Reminded that Elgar 's violin concerto is sublime , as in scary beautiful - thx @BBCRadio3
If you love Handel ... great arias with the great @EnglishConcert Harry Bicket @BBCRadio3 listen for 30 days #Handel #opera @bbcproms
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 You‚Äôre not even trying to hide it now . Brazen .
@JeremyPound71 @BBCRadio3 The man is a genius .
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 not so sure about Adlestrop . Ruins a good poem
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 This is horrible . It sounds like a murder - not at all evocative of the poem .
@BBCRadio3 who wouldn‚Äôt love this Respighi !
@BBCRadio3 The pines on the Janiculum . The photo is not that sharp but I still like it .
@PetrocTrelawny @DunkinWedd @BBCRadio3 Almost a mini train theme on R3 this morning , with this and then Adlestrop later .
@gavinplumley @kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 It may be time to make my Bacharach before 7 suggestion again .
@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Looking back @PetrocTrelawny could have done things differently ...
@johnshea63 @kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Nat√ºrlich .
@PetrocTrelawny !!!!!! Is this the worst piece of music EVER played on @BBCRadio3 - loving your sense of humour this morning !
Check out the Night Blossoms series on bbcradio3 for interesting shows about‚Ä¶
@DSinck @kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 As someone who has sung the only two lines of that song that I know repeatedly in the bath , I feel sympathetic to this request
@duncanjam22 @BBCRadio3 that is a fair point . I apologise to the master .
@MannGeorgia @DSinck @kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 I'll be tuned in .
@AliceCoote @EnglishConcert @BBCRadio3 @bbcproms I still get goosebumps when I remember this concert üé∂üé∂üíï
Oh ! Friends ' son playing the cello in Faure 's Cantique de Jean Racine on @BBCRadio3
Simply beautiful cantique de jean Racine @BBCRadio3 I had to wait to leave the car until it had finished
Was this the worst piece of music ever broadcast on @BBCRadio3 tweeted a listener of Beethoven 's mandolin piece . No , not even the worst I've heard today ! Not a masterpiece , merely a piece by a master . But I enjoyed its soulful perkiness whatever others may say ...
Hop on board our aural gondola and enjoy the exquisite Barcarolle from Offenbach 's The Tales of Hoffmann . What do you want to hear next on the #EssentialClassics playlist for your journey round Venice ?
How beautiful is Faur√©s‚Äô Cantique de Jean Racine . Just heard it on @BBCRadio3 and stopped everything I was doing .
@BBCRadio3 How beautiful the Cantique de Jean Racine conducted by @ANethsingha was just now . I first heard it @ExeterCathedral , conducted by his father , Lucian Nethsingha , many years ago now . Tempus fugit .
Recital by @LucyParham this Friday @KingsPlace . You can also hear Lucy live on @BBCRadio3 In Tune TODAY #pianist
@BBCRadio3 It 's Wednesday today , not Tuesday as Ian Skelly mentioned ! Cheers .
@kathystott @BBCRadio3 I‚Äôm singing that in my choir this term ! So excited to learn it ; it‚Äôs so beautiful
@BBCRadio3 The " Adagietto " from Mahler 5 please .
Working and catching up with Aaron Copland as composer of the week in @BBCRadio3
@iamaweasel @BBCRadio4 @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 A few days ago , the BBC described him as a Leading Eurosceptic ....... must be awful to be described as a Leading Sceptic in any field !
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Flanders and Swann wrote The Slow Train about the closing of all the branch lines by Beeching . Joe Stilgoe does a great version of this . Please play it tomorrow .
@MannGeorgia @kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 This reminds me a little of when @clemencybh a couple of years ago requested ideas for music about boats , or sea journeys or something , and loads of listeners suggested " Ferry Across the Mersey ". In the end , to call their bluff , she played it just before 9:00 !
@BBCRadio3 Scarlatti . Love to all bbc radios and Chris
üéâTune in tonight from 7.30 pm @bbcradio3 to hear @LElschenbroich perform @MarkSimpson_88 's Cello Concerto , recorded on Saturday 21 April @BridgewaterHall üéâ
@BBCRadio3 how about Liszt‚Äôs Lugubre Gondolier ?
@iestyn_davies @LNethsingha @SJCChoir @BBCRadio3 @3 @BBCSingers ‚ÄòOh come along , let‚Äôs just get the thing done properly ... ‚Äô
@BBCRadio3 to do with water At Night on a Beach Alone from Vaughan Williams‚Äôs 2nd Symphony . Rather reflective vision , staring out to sea ?
@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 In my car earlier , stuck behind a lorry doing 30mph ( 60mph limit) , this lovely piece helped to ease my stress . Anthony Payne‚Äôs completion , with very little original material , of Elgar‚Äôs 3rd Symphony is magnificent .
@BBCRadio3 After the sweetness and light I would go for the more muscular duet with two male voices from Verdi 's Don Carlos ' Dio , che nell'alma infondere'.
@BBCRadio3 the duet from The Pearl Fishers , the title eludes me , would be perfect I think .
@BBCRadio3 I would suggest another great French aria ¬´ Mon c≈ìur s‚Äôouvre √† ta voix ¬ª from Samson &amp; Delilah by Saint-Sa√´ns .
@BBCRadio3 I understand why Essential Classics had to change ( I think ) but , but ... Some things work ; others , such as yesterday 's part of Sibelius 5 , surely miss the point .
A shame that no recordings were made of Katherine Mansfield 's singing ( a soprano) . @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 @AlexArchivists
@BBCRadio3 great hearing the Poukenc this morning for brass !
Chris Wood talking about " music to make the stones hum ". Wonderful radio , thanks @BBCRadio3
Ah , my childhood home of West Bridgford gets a mention on @BBCRadio3 . And is that my friend Barbara in Bristol getting a namecheck too ? World suddenly feeling small .
@kathystott @BBCRadio3 It‚Äôs incredible and the funny thing is that EVERYONE knows it in France , like a certain pomp and circumstance in the UK , I know which one I prefer and there‚Äôs not a flag in sight !
@BBCRadio3 how about Elgar‚Äôs Fairy Pipers ( Wand of Youth Suite 1 ) as a contrasting companion to Offenbach‚Äôs Barcarolle ? Venice became important to Elgar shortly after the Wand of Youth , as he spent time there working on his 2nd Symphony .
@StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 A million years ago ( probably nearer 60 than 50 ) @BBCRadio4 ' s ( Home Service ? ) Book at Bedtime was Gabriel Wolff reading Adam Bede and the introductory music was Schubert 's Fantasia for 2 pianos . A glorious combination , all new to me ( perhaps not GB )
@badgerlyminge @BBCRadio3 @BBCRadio4 Ah - Gabriel Woolf - what a reader !!!!! Hopefully , he'll be reading at the pre-concert for my Bus Pass concert in December ...
@BBCRadio3 I'm so pleased you're playing the fantastic " Des Canyons ". I love all of Messiaen 's works but " Des Canyons " seems to be so rarely performed and always overshadowed by Turangalila . Wondering whether the wind machine is considered to be a wind instrument ? :-)
@kathystott @BBCRadio3 It 's &gt; heaven &lt; , isn't it ! One of those extraordinary pieces where one feels Faur√© was trying to write something pretty , but stumbled upon pure beauty almost by accident . And he was still at school .
Today at 15:30 we are singing Choral Evensong live on @BBCRadio3 , where we will perform Howells ' ' Gloucester Service ' and Taverner 's ' Dum transisset Sabbatum'. Join us @stjohnscam Chapel ( to be seated at 15:15 ) or listen on the radio or online here :
@kathyclugston @BBCRadio3 Less of this kind of thing , to adapt Father Ted . Does Radio2 broadcast in vain ?
@BBCRadio3 my first session of Quimiotherapy today . The music for The Big Country credits suddenly explodes in the earphones . I am outta here and galloping full speed through the texan plains . The magic of music . Thank you E . C .
Radio 3 in Concert - Shostakovich 10 from 1:09 : 30 . Simply magical ! @BBCRadio3
@kathystott @BBCRadio3 Written when he was in his teens too . Sublime indeed
@PetrocTrelawny @DunkinWedd @BBCRadio3 Can we hear the other bridges please .
@handheldcamera @AndyHearn09 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BBCRadio4 @BBCRadio3 and @PetrocTrelawny is the only way to go now in the morning
@RoseUnwin @BBCRadio3 Thanks ! Hope you like it .
@StevenIsserlis @BBCRadio3 @BBCRadio4 Is he really still around ? Wonderful voice
" There was no one near to confuse me , so I was forced to become original ."
Dear @BBCRadio3 #BBC , please reinvent this useful feature . I'd like to be able to click on a piece and hear the whole thing . It used to be possible . Why is it not any more ?
If you want to hear Dunkin Wedd crossing the Tamar , it 's at 54 , as the BBC 's site doesn't tell you /any more/ . @BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny
@kathystott @BBCRadio3 Always been a favourite since I played it in a flute choir
@SharpV50 @BBCRadio3 Eek üò¨üòÖüé∂
@kathyclugston @PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 Please don't give in @PetrocTrelawny I love Benny and Bjorn , but not when I'm in the mood for Respighi ( which was a great way to start the day ) :-)
The sound accompanying human life for millennia ...
I was back on @BBCRadio3 this morning doing the ' Time Traveller ' segment for Essential Classics . Today 's topic : the sassy Victorian spinsters I tweeted about back in February ! [ my bit starts at about 1:13 : 00 in ]
@VCH_London A Bursary Klaxon is an instrument which would be at home on Late Junction @BBCRadio3
@DigiVictorian @BBCRadio3 I‚Äôll listen to that on my drive home üòå
More Night Blossoms @BBCRadio3 üå∏
Never listened to @bbcradio3 before but @elizabethalker ' s #unclassified is my new favourite radio show . Discovering loads of new composers like Poppy Ackroyd . If you're a fan of neo classical , or ambient techno would highly recommend
Listen on @BBCRadio3 from 2pm today ! üéß
@BBCRadio3 pssssst ... someone tell Ian that bus passes are from 60 , not 65 ... üëçü§ìüöç
Thank you @BBCRadio3 ... ‚ù§Ô∏è Copland ‚ù§Ô∏è now playing
@kathystott @BBCRadio3 Lucky enough to have sung it with @VivaceChorus in Venice , Salzburg and Vienna . Always delicious üòä
@SharpV50 @yearinthcountry @BBCRadio3 Great interview.....i'm intrigued by the film .
@elizabethalker #Unclassified @BBCRadio3 is outstanding . Just so good .
@kathystott @BBCRadio3 Composers are sometimes magicians ; they can make time stop . The Cantique is one of those rare pieces .
We feel you deserve a rather special musical mini-break ...
Aaron Copland‚Äôs ‚ÄòAppalachian Spring‚Äô , was played just now on @BBCRadio3 . Absolutely beautiful . What a gem on this rainy spring day ! Terrific vox pop of Copeland talking about it prior to a performance as well . Very funny . #aaroncopland #ClassicalMusic
You : Hmmm , I need some new and exciting and innovative and extraordinary music to listen to ... Us : THIS !
@BBCRadio3 I didn‚Äôt even know about this series - right up my street .

üöå How many hours of your life have you spent standing at one ?
@BBCRadio3 Wait a minute , R3 - this is really about *bus-shelters* , not bus-stops ? What percentage of stops actually have shelters ?
@BBCRadio3 The bus-stop at which , if one ran from school , one *might* catch a bus at something like 3.40 ( it was known to be ahead of schedule) , but would otherwise then have to wait till 4.10 for the next one ( if it ever turned up ) led to concluding that one could walk home in that time ...
Up next on @BBCRadio3 - our concert celebrating musical settings of the Welsh poet George Herbert , including music by @benparrymusic and #Britten
From the Tale of Genjii to Godzilla , Kenzaburo Oe to Yoko Tawada ‚Ä¶

@LElschenbroich @BBCFrontRow @BBCRadio4 @MarkSimpson_88 @BBCRadio3 @BBCPhilharmonic @macbethmedia Nice ! But who is this ' Lennon Elschenbroch ?'
@BBCRadio3 FYI=
@BBCRadio3 Mahler 9 Adagio or Mahler Das Lied Von der Erde : Der Abschied
@BBCRadio3 The choir of New College Oxford under Edward Higginbottom recorded Ave Maria set to this music on their CD ' Illumina Music of Light ' It is just beautiful and I really recommend that everyone listens to it .
@BBCRadio3 I naturally think of the second movement of Sibelius ' Violin Concerto for the same sense of deep yearning .
@BBCRadio3 Arvo Part 's " Silouans Song " The subject matter of " Death in Venice " now seems very distasteful and I've done my best to disassociate the Mahler from the film .
@BBCRadio3 to follow slow movement from stringy Mahler 5 how about slow second from Beethoven‚Äôs 5th Piano Concerto . Similar tone , more moving , less saccharine if you ask me .
@BBCRadio3 Anything not quite so mawkish welcome
@BBCRadio3 how about Samuel Barber‚Äôs Angus Dei ?
@BBCRadio3 If you're not going to play the antidote ( the mother from ' Death in Venice ' ) then perhaps ' Sleep ' by Ivor Gurney . Beautiful and heart-tugging .
@BBCRadio3 Loving the show Suzie ; how about Tchaikovsky 's 4th Symphony second movement : the peace after the tensions of the first movement should match the chocolate box Mahler
@BBCRadio3 May I suggest 10 minutes of silence ?
@BBCRadio3 @PR0VIDENCE I quite enjoy being in front of an audience‚Ä¶point no . 2 is probably the one that makes the most sense for me‚Ä¶ #AndNobodyDied
@BBCRadio3 This gimmick has run it 's course . Time to stop trying to be Classic FM 2 .
@BBCRadio3 ' Beatle Bones ‚Äòn‚Äô Smokin‚Äô Stones ' by Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band ? Or maybe something by Arvo P√§rt ?
#BBCRadio3 Why did Haydn and Mozart learn nothing from Bach ?
@BBCRadio3 Today I would have chosen L‚Äôincoronazione di Poppea to follow the Mahler .
What keeps a musician playing at 94 ? For Menahem Pressler , the answer is simple : it‚Äôs love :

@BBCRadio3 What a ghastly performance of Schumann : the right hand totally out of sync with the left ( always behind , like Cpl Jones) ! Ugh !
Do you think Schubert would have had more luck finishing his 8th symphony if he'd faced the piano ? In lieu of the 3rd and 4th movements , what piece of music would you like to hear next on the #EssentialClassics playlist ?
@BBCRadio3 Will the Strictly performance be available on iplayer for a while ?
@BBCRadio3 Not Schubert , but lovely piano music on right now .
Have you discovered R3 Through the Night yet ? Six hours of @EBU_HQ concerts and recordings to keep you musical company every night . No need to lose sleep , though - you can listen on demand any time ! Here‚Äôs the current 30 day archive .
@BBCRadio3 Maybe his dog could have finished a ruff-ruff version .
@BBCRadio3 An unfinished symphony ? What about Borodin 's 3rd ? Should be heard more often !
@BBCRadio3 a movement from that marvellous realisation by Anthony Payne of Elgar 's Symphony No . 3 would be most welcome . Or the Pomp &amp; Circumstance March No . 6 ?
@BBCRadio3 If Schubert‚Äôs 8th introduced the romantic symphony , was Mahler‚Äôs 8th its grandest epitome ? Berlin Phil , please .
@BBCRadio3 Switched the radio on during the Schubert not realising it was for the playlist . Hadn‚Äôt noticed before the extent to which it anticipates the Tchaikovsky of the Path√©tique and Romeo and Juliet , and could swear I heard the Nibelung briefly lamenting their lot .
@BBCRadio3 The Essential Classics programme has become unlistenable . Choked with trivia and pointless features , and the music is drawn from a narrow range of popular pieces , or just extracts . One only has to listen for a few days to hear the same pieces of music being repeated over . üò≥

@BBCRadio3 @bbcstrictly #BiggestWeekend @bbcittakestwo Love the strictly set , was possibly most thrilled to spot the lovely Vicky Gill in the crowd and seeing her costumes in the flesh ! A fabulous set ! Well done to all involved !
@BBCRadio3 these reinterpretations on #Vivaldi 's #FourSeasons are great , interesting and probably needed so that future generations can once again sit back and hear the concertos in unadorned original glory .
@BBCRadio3 it‚Äôs a long time since I wanted to throw a brick at the radio but Nigel Kennedy on #BiggestWeeekend with his take on Vivaldi makes me feel like doing so .
@BBCRadio3 It‚Äôs amazing ! Got it on the radio , Bose speakers turned up , bbc4 on ( sound muted ) for visuals - excellent festival going- close up view from my sofa with prosecco , and my own bed later ! Thank you BBC
üé∂ Violin virtuoso @nigel_kennedy and the @BBCCO wow the crowds with this lovely bit of Vivaldi as they bring #BiggestWeekend to a close üéª

@pawboy2 total crap on #BBCRadio3 too - what 's going on ?
@BBCRadio3 @nigel_kennedy @BBCCO Vivaldi . I Love it . Wonderful Nigel . üëç
@BBCRadio3 @nigel_kennedy @BBCCO It‚Äôs out of tune and frankly pretty awful
@BBCRadio3 @bbcstrictly Oh , for crying out loud ! Just stop it Radio 3 , and act your age !
@BBCRadio3 @nigel_kennedy @BBCCO @nigel_kennedy was excellent . Loved the Hendrix . Best performance by anyone in a Villa shirt for years üéªüëèüëèüëè
@BBCRadio3 @nigel_kennedy @BBCCO It WAS amazing , but define ' crowds'?
@BBCRadio3 @nigel_kennedy That sudden smile seemed more a stab of pain at the thought of the Mighty Villa spending a third season languishing in the Championship . #avfc
@BBCRadio3 I don't think it 's fair to say the version of Pavane Op 50 with lyrics is weak . I feel Xzibit provides a strong performance ....
@BBCRadio3 @nigel_kennedy @BBCCO Sorry but I turned it off

Ravel 's Jeux d‚Äôeau kicks off our search for a new piece to join the #EssentialClassics playlist today . Do you have any watery suggestions for us ?
@BBCRadio3 I would choose Debussy 's book 2 prelude number 8 ' Ondine ' the water nymph . Both pieces are inspired by water and for piano and composed within 10 years . Ian Chard on Skye .

@BBCRadio3 @jonnytrunk Great programme last night !
" One night , in the year 1713 I dreamed I had made a pact with the devil for my soul ." Virtuosic violinist Aleksey Semenenko plays Tartini 's fiendish Devil 's Trill
@BBCRadio3 I think Debussy‚Äôs La Cathedrel Engloutie would be the perfect match , to explore the expressive powers that the piano has to offer . Certainly conjure up a fine picture of what Debussy intended .
@BBCRadio3 The tempo marking is rather fun .
@BBCRadio3 Try Casadesus recording , the live one if you can fine it .
@BBCRadio3 @jonnytrunk I dream of being that organised !
@BBCRadio3 As a follow-up , how about Sciarrino 's " Anamorfosi " which is an extremely clever ( and somewhat humorous ! ) combination of Jeu d'eau and " Singing in the rain ". There 's a brilliant recording by Marc Andre Hamelin .

@BBCRadio3 Haydn probably knew Mozart by the time that concerto ( no . 11 ) was written ( circa 1784) , so it is possible there may have been some Mozartian influence .
@BBCRadio3 Good grief , what a dismal version of " In trutina "!! If it was in the minor , I'd call it funereal . üò≤

@BBCRadio3 Fantastic early music programme ... here is what unites us . Thank you
@BBCRadio3 No . You call that phrasing ? I hear halting , stuttering , meretricious arrogance . It 's all about the performer and nothing about the music .
@BBCRadio3 What on earth is this mediaeval nonsense ? There is no place for religious twaddle on a mainstream radio channel in an irreligious and secular society .
If #CharlotteHawkins is going to spend the afternoon regurgitating the Royal Wedding , I'm turning over to @BBCRadio3 @ClassicFM #ClassicFM
@BBCRadio3 @tomservice Is that claves pattern really syncopation ? I hear just one pulse that is off the beat : - 2 3 - 1 ( 2 ) - 4 , the 2nd beat of the 2nd of the pair of bars . Beethoven 's use of syncopation in pno sonata in A Op . 101 1st mvt is pure genius .
@BBCRadio3 #WordsandMusic is so consistently good that I almost wish I had a queue on the #A1 to sit in for the next hour or so . This week , a #RoyalWedding theme .

@BBCRadio3 I think there will be a lot of suggestions for " calm after the storm " from Beethoven 's Pastoral Symphony but I propose Johann Strauss 's " Thunder and lightning polka " in keeping with the storm theme . A great fun piece .
@BBCRadio3 To follow Tchaikovsky 's " Storm ", how about his depiction of a truly stormy ( not to say steamy ) passion ? His symphonic fantasy " Francesca da Rimini ". #EssentialClassics
@BBCRadio3 playing Monteverdi 's Magnificat in eight parts on the memorial of #MaryMotheroftheChurch . Lovely .

@BBCRadio3 - The Robinson Crusoe theme ; I‚Äôm whisked back half a century and I‚Äôm in bits !
@BBCRadio3 Ah , @drsarahwalker but do you remember " The Flashing Blade "? [ And Ivanhoe which used Tchaikovsky 's 4th symphony ( 4th movement ) at the end credits ? ]
@BBCRadio3 that Robinson Crusoe doesn't sound right without the speed wobbling from a too often played tape
@BBCRadio3 I think the perfect companion piece to this is Tippett‚Äôs Fantasia on a theme by Corelli . Simples .
@IAMKP @BBCRadio3 Just heard on catch up and found myself crying at the end . Thank you again for your inspiring work
After all the battle-themed music on @BBCRadio3 this morning , how about Sally Beamish 's violin concerto ?

@PetrocTrelawny @BBCRadio3 - Forgotten Artists . Any chance of anything of the French Violinist Ginette Neveu ( 1919-1949) . A friend of mine saw her at The Philharmonic Hall , Liverpool after WWII &amp; I only have her account of the Sibelius Violin Concerto on EMI . Worth a play ?
@BBCRadio3 oh yes I forgot about this number ! Played this in a brass band Brighton and Hove City Brass .

@BBCRadio3 As it‚Äôs Matthew Rose‚Äôs 40th birthday wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to have him singing Bass Strauss equivalent ? You must have in your archives his recording of Das Thal or Der Einsame w Ji≈ô√≠ Bƒõlohl√°vek BBCSO c . 2004 for voices programme ? He‚Äôd be very happy if you did !
@BBCRadio3 Arvo Part‚Äôs Spiegel Im Spiegel - the quietest of reflections in the simplest language . When all‚Äôs said and done what more do you need at the end of the day .....?

@BBCRadio3 David Bowie cited Strauss 's 4 last songs as very important to him towards the end of his life . How about following the Strauss with Bowie 's ambient , haunting The Mysteries from The Buddha of Suburbia
@BBCRadio3 " Im Abendrot ", truly music to die for - and to . To follow , more music in Abschied/farewell mode ? How about Beethoven 's Piano Sonata 26 " Les Adieux "? Or the final movement of Mahler 's " Das Lied von der erde "?
excellent progress with @BFCS1856 on the @BBCRadio3 Pankhurst Anthem , looking forward to this on June 9th alongside choral music by Lili Boulanger + songs by the 17thC Barbara Strozzi and @JenniferWalshe , sung by the brilliant @Peyee_Chen
@BBCRadio3 How do you follow that ? I would humbly suggest‚Äú Nun seh‚Äô ich wohl ... ‚Äù from Mahler‚Äôs Kindert≈çtenlieder .
@roseandfriends @BBCRadio3 Happy birthday Matthew .
If you heard how enthusiastic Verity was about @aecrankies on @BBCRadio3 last night , you won‚Äôt want to miss them here on Weds 16 .
@LucasRosemary @BBCRadio3 Thanks !!
@BBCRadio3 . What should follow the Norman/Masur Im Abendrot ? Well anything but that turgid garbled sloppy rendition . How about Studer/Sinopoli , Janowitz/Karajan , Schwarzkopf/Szell or even the Fleming/Thielemann . Anything but Norman ( Kanawa/Solti excepted which is even worse ! )
#recorderpower yesterday @ @BBCRadio3 #LateJunction
@BBCRadio3 Can't think - still got tears in my eyes . Classic recording though
@BBCRadio3 To follow the last of Strauss 's four last songs , how about @GeraldFinley singing Kom nu hit , dod from In the Stream of Life , Songs by Sibelius ? His beautiful baritone would complete the image of the couple watching the sunset ....
If you missed the @BBCRadio3 broadcast of @LElschenbroich 's performance of the premiere of @MarkSimpson_88 's Cello Concerto , listen again here :

@Sadgrovem @BBCRadio3 I agree with your point but , in all honesty , have never thought of a Bach Toccata and Fugue as ‚Äòminiaturist‚Äô . Conversely , having lived in college next to a guy who played the whole Ring on several weekends , I reckon Wagner goes way beyond full size !

@drol007 @BBCRadio4 @Liz_ORiordan @BBCRadio3 I‚Äôve moved on to the @thecultcast podcast while I work .
@drol007 @BBCRadio4 @Liz_ORiordan @BBCRadio3 Used to listen to R4 every morning on the way to work but now I need to sing to work off the the pre work day angst ...
@Mummydoc1 @BBCRadio4 @Liz_ORiordan @BBCRadio3 Something for everyone #r4seriously #Fortunately @BBCInOurTime @BBCMoreOrLess does my week plus the life scientific and @tomservice
Journey down the #Cuckmere with @EdHughes16 and @cescaeaton on Music Matters 12.15 today @BBCRadio3 @brightfest
Michael Collins ' album of Crusell Clarinet Concertos now on @BBCRadio3 's #RecordReview . Listen to the full album now on @Spotify #NowPlaying
@sioncorn It‚Äôs a beautiful programme . It‚Äôs part of a series on Japan on @BBCRadio3 which , if you scramble around their website , are mostly downloadable . Very worthwhile use of your time . @jakebearne1
@teigngardener @BBCRadio3 @jakebearne1 Oh really ? Sound right up my street - thanks :-)
Really enjoyed this @BBCRadio3 #composeroftheweek . Sorry to say I didn‚Äôt know much about Copeland
@johnshea63 @BBCRadio3 @RadiowaDwojka @EBU_HQ Yes . All ' world music . Love to all bbc radios and Chris
@rfdenison @cescaeaton @BBCRadio3 @brightfest Thank you @rfdenison Stunning aerial and ground photography and brilliant live musicians @OrchestraSl - performing tonight @AttenboroughCtr @SussexUni in @brightfest - also tomorrow/Sunday at 5pm
Taking water in Leamington Spa for @BBCRadio3 . It‚Äôs an acquired taste ... @TomParnellMcr @bonaomi1
@andrewCDmcg @BelceaQuartet @BBCRadio3 This was very good .
My cultural influences are nothing if not eclectic . I hear a discussion @bbcradio3 about a major new opera based on Marlowe 's Edward II and this Jimmy Webb song springs to mind .
Gwerth ei glywed , gyda @OPRAcymru a @gwennosaunders Music Matters - George Benjamin - @BBCRadio3
On top of this , Gareth Williams is now on @BBCRadio3 talking about @PendyrusChoir , the Welsh language &amp; the #Rhondda‚Äôs fantastic working class choral traditions . üé∂ @DanielGwydion
‚ÄúYou've been making the wrong mistakes . ‚Äù
@StuartGlover @BBCRadio2 @BBCRadio3 There‚Äôs a new one there for you now Stuart ‚Äî available from yesterday
@ChrisMasonBBC @BBCRadio2 @BBCRadio3 I thought the guy cooking a stir fry " serious wokin '" was a new high .
üê¶ üé∂ Can you identify this bird from its song alone ? A lovely #birdsong quiz :
Tonight on @BBCRadio3 Hear &amp; Now I join Robert Worby to spin some of the latest , hottest new music discs . Some totally great music included .
@ChrisMasonBBC @BBCRadio2 @BBCRadio3 Both right up my street . I love stumbling across some great composers or Opera on 3 whilst I'm stuck in traffic . Are you referring to the legendary @tonyblackburn btw . He is so quick witted and punchy . The new jocks are so verbose .
@samholloway @ChrisMasonBBC @BBCRadio2 @BBCRadio3 Isn't wokin living in Woking .?
@BBCRadio3 Good morning ! How about a selection of Spanish Songs by Shostakovich Be rather different , I think ?
@BBCRadio3 How about the finale of Dvorak 's Violin Concerto as an encore to the Lalo ?
@BBCRadio3 I think a great companion to the Lalo would be Ravel‚Äôs great Tzigane , a comparably exuberant rhapsody for violin .
@BBCRadio3 I can no longer tweet a link via the iplayer . I can‚Äôt understand why this function has disappeared .
@BBCRadio3 I loved this programme !
@BBCRadio3 ' Complexe mais pas compliqu√©e ' is apparently how Ravel suggested to Vaughan Williams music should be . A bon mot applicable in many contexts , even #ameding #editing @TheSfEP @copyeditors
@BBCRadio3 No ... as you ask again , I still can't hear it . I still hear stuttering phrases , wild changes of tempo that severely challenge the description of rubato , and a complete absence of the dance .
@BBCRadio3 @jordanbpeterson Phillip Dodd was unprofessional . He interrupted mid answer , he asserted false strawman examples , and he did not acknowledge Peterson 's clear refutations of the false analogies .
" The only way we move forward is when we're hopeful . When we're hopeful , we invest in the future . When we're hopeful , we reach out to other people . When we're in despair , we shut ourselves off ." Be inspired by the wonderful @JoyceDiDonato on #EssentialClassics all this week .
Listen up ! Performing live on the show today we have the amazing @IKanneh ahead of @thekannehmasons performance at the Bath Festival on 25th and 26th of May !
Bravo to pupils from Hyndland Secondary School in Glasgow who have taken on our 2018 commission , The Pankhurst Anthem . We love this spoken word approach with wind band ! Feeling inspired ?
@BBCRadio3 no escape from Chelsea flower show . PLEEEEEASE play music and stop this inane waffle !
Looking forwards to it !
@BBCRadio3 @R3TheVerb @robinince Is it your intention to appear on every radio show ever recorded ?
There 's so much Baroque brilliance going on in the studio right now ! Tune in to hear @solomonsknot live on In Tune !
@BBCRadio3 This isn't just ' interval music'. This is astonishing ! Who is it ? :)
@BBCRadio3 I appreciate you have to balance old with new but please , the Gerald Barry piano concerto is absolute and total rubbish . To include that in a concert with Beethoven is an insult to your listeners ' integrity . Never play that piece again , ever .
@BBCRadio3 announcer : ‚ÄòThat was Brahms‚Äô Serenade no 1 ending the mix tape . Before that we heard Liszt , Mendelssohn , Sibelius , Lully ... and a particular highlight was the theme from Jurassic Park . ‚Äô Hahahaha !! #sublime/ridiculous #tongue/cheek ( I hope) . #bbcradio3
" I abandon myself to the fever of dreams , in search for new laws ..." #LateJunction or The Theatre Of Cruelty ? A sonic tribute to dramatist and surrealist Antonin Artaud .
@BBCRadio3 Brilliant . This episode is not available on iPlayer .
